        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Our project comes about from a fascination with the incredibly brave and talented men (and women!) racers
            that continue to show up every year at the Isle of Man TT and challenge world records, personal bests, and
            each other.  After watching several documentaries about the annual TT races (including those already
            mentioned on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>,
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">TT3D: Closer To The Edge</a> and the BBC
            ITV4 documentary
            <a href="http://www.touchline.tv/tv/motorsport/manx-grand-prix-documentary-on-itv4">Grand Prix Racer</a>)
            David was inspired to see if he could do some interesting visualizations on rider performance, learn more
            about how long it takes riders to become proficient on the <a href="maps.html">Snaefell Mountain Course</a>,
            and also create some really fun and interactive visualizations of the rich dataset that the official
            <a href="http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database.aspx">Isle of Man TT Database website</a> provides (particularly
            because the official database website is primarily a relatively flat, boring dump of "numbers in tables"
            kind of datadump, it was ripe for being the datasource for visualizing).</p><br />
        <p>After David and Leo teamed up to work on the project, we were both also inspired by the example provided in
            the <a href="[LINK TO OFFICIAL PROJECT 2 PDF SPEC HERE]">Project II</a> project document of "A good
            multi-view example" of the <a href="http://cscheid.net/static/mlb足hall足of足fame足voting/">MLB Hall of Fame
            Voting</a>, where it showed lines for each player and showed how many votes they received each year until
            they reached (or in several cases, did not reach) enough votes to gain entry into the MLB Hall of Fame.
            We felt that a graph like this for our Isle of Man TT rider and race data would be a neat way to visualize
            how a rider has performed in the TT races over the years, and give us insight into our primary research
            question, which is <b><i>"How long does it take most riders to become proficient at the Isle of Man
            TT?"</i></b></p><br />
        <p>We felt that we should focus our analysis of the rich 100+ year history of the Isle of Man TT by focusing in
            on the <a href="[LINK TO THE IOMTT DATABASE COMPETITITIONS 1991-PRESENT PAGE HERE]">modern era</a> of the
            TT because the motorcycles used today are so vastly superior to those of earlier eras that the comparison
            of older data to present-day data would not be fair (it is common for the best riders of today to reach
            speeds in excess of 200 MPH on some of the straights at the <a href="maps.html">Snaefell Mountain
            Course</a>.</p><br />

        <p>To see the code we used to scrape the data from the TT Database and also the JavaScript / HTML / CSS
            / jQuery / D3 code we used to create the primary visualization, see our
            <a href="https://github.com/rayden7/cs171-project02">Project II Github repository</a>.</p><br />

        <h2>Software & Tools Used</h2>
        <p>David is a "Mac guy", Leo is a "PC guy", but we were able to share several tools and applications on both
            platforms.  Software, programming languages, toolkits, and services used to create this visualization:</p>

        <h2>Opportunities For Improvements on Project III</h2>
        <p>While we are very proud of what we were able to accomplish in the short amount of time we had for
            Project 2, and despite many very long hours of work, there are several areas that we would like to improve
            upon for our upcoming Project 3 submission that would make this visualization even better:</p>

        <ul class="left-margin-bump">
            <li><span class="category-header">Individual Rider Filtering:</span> similar to how the MLB Hall of Fame
                Voting visualization allows you to search for individuals by name, we would also like to be able to
                search for individual racers by name and then show appropriate visualizations for the riders that
                were found (or selected from a list)</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">Animations & Transitions:</span> it would be nice to have smoothly
                animating transitions when selecting different riders so that not all the interactivity is purely
                ON / OFF when mousing over something</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">Better Contexual Selections / Mouseovers:</span> when you mouseover a
                racing line, it would be nice to have all the other lines have their opacity change so that the
                primary visualization appears "less busy"</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">"Sticky Rider Selections":</span> currently when you mouse over a rider's
                racing line in the primary visualization, you are shown a very nice information panel on the rider on
                the right, and you also get 2 or 3 nice smaller custom visualizations of the rider's race class
                performance underneath the primary visualization; however, when you mouse out from that racing line
                those areas go away, and so we don't really allow the viewer to play with or explore the rider detail
                panel or the graphs below.  We would like to modify the primary visualization so that if you mouse over
                and then click on a rider's racing line, that the rider detail panel and the smaller lower
                visualizations "stick" so that the viewer can explore and play with those areas (in particular the
                rider detail panel, because that one contains links for the rider to other websites, etc.).</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">Rider Performance Comparisons:</span> one thing we would like to do to
                make the visualization truly powerful would be to let you select 2 riders (perhaps more, but we would
                need to explore this further) from a list (or simply allow selecting 2 different rider race lines)
                and then show those riders primary race lines in two different colors on the primary visualization area
                for easier visual comparison.</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">All Rider Race Class Performances Shown:</span> currently you may mouse
                over each race line, and each line represents how <b>one rider</b> has performed in all annual
                competitions in <b>one race class</b>.  We would like to enable allowing the viewer to see highlighted
                <b>all</b> of a currently-selected rider's race class performance lines (that would help to show if a
                rider has a race class "speciality" compared to other race classes, for exmaple)</li>
            <li><span class="category-header">Bugfix: Show Race Lines Moused Over Above All Other Race Lines:</span>
                this is a tricky bug that we were unable to solve in time fo r Project 2, despite our best efforts</li>
